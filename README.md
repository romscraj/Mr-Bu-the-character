Mr Bu the character
==============
Mr Bu character designed and drawn by Md Noh, using Windows® Paint Version 5.1. Inspiration taken 
from the notorious Ikea® man (or perhaps woman), with that signature distinctive groovy zoot suit cum 
loon pants cum palazzo pants inspired jumpsuit.

Mr Bu has absolutely no hair and truly has no skin 
colour – he is transparent. His aerodynamic, wind-tunnel-efficient head was inspired from (one half of) 
the RepRap logo.

Due to his addiction to coffee (consuming 170 cups a day on average), he has since 
given up on bringing around with him numerous Thermos® flasks filled with brewed coffee (28 of them, 
totalling approximately 34 litres of coffee) and has switched to carrying packets of instant coffee sachets 
which he keeps in numerous specially tailored, internally accessible pockets within his jumpsuit.
